 Main program.
 Supply 4 command-line arguments:
 - size of the queue
 - number of jobs to generate for each producer
 - number of producers
 - number of consumers
 Example execution: ./main 5 6 2 3

 Please note that MacOS doesnâ€™t support unnamed semaphores
 (sem_init() and sem_destroy()), only named semaphores
 (sem_open()) and sem_close()).
